### Codewars Example
Return the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them)
```
function solution(number){
  if(number < 3) return 0
  let result = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < number; i++){
    if(i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0) {
      result += i
    }
  }
  return result
}
```
